# Example Client Certificates

For test purposes I created some user client certificates based on a self-assigned certificate (myCA). Feel free to download it for your own tests. Please don't use them for productive environments ;-).

To install the user certificate on the client, please download the p12 files on the related client. Please use the username for the password.
